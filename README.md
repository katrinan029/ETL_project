## E(xtract) T(ransform) L(oad) Project

For this project, I scraped the * [transparent California website](https://transparentcalifornia.com/salaries/search/?q=police&y=2019) to obtain police salary for 2019. The website restricts visitors to only scrape 50 pages or 2,500 records. 

More info regarding the datasets and the steps for ETL can be found in the report.
